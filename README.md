The game is about you playing as a resurrected skeleton trying to get out of the Graveyard to wreak havoc in the Land of the Living. You first start out with nothing, so you must go out and collect items, weapons, shields, etc to fight your way out of the Graveyard. There are many enemies that will challenge you and even a boss battle. There is a combat system and a gold mechanic which allows you to buy items or repair shields. The game also consists of a variety of 'areas' for you to traverse and get to know the lore of the game's universe.
